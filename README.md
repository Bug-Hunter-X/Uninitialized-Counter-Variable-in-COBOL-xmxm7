This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: uninitialized variables. The `bug.cob` file contains a program that attempts to count to 10, but the counter variable is not initialized before the loop starts. This can result in unpredictable behavior, as the initial value of the variable is undefined.  The solution, `bugSolution.cob` shows the corrected code with proper variable initialization.
